# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is the process where a code runs an action over and over again until a condition is met. My experience with it revolves around loops and mostly for problem solving

  Researched answer: Iteration is very much what I posted above but to be more technical; iteration is a continuous process of block code execution used to complete a condition set by the maker. For loops is a common iteration and uses in, of or await in order to produce the desired outcome.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: I don't exactly recall the parameters of .map(). I know there three and I'm almost certain that I have notes about what certain variables are a big no-no. However, I am very aware of where to look that up when I need it, and with your blessing, I'd be glad to take the steps to gather that information for you.

  Researched answer: .maps(), like .filter, have three parameters built-in and they are value, index, and array. Also
  I should have defintely known that one. I was overthinking it.



3. What is object destructuring? Destructuring is a tool Javascript uses to seperate values in objects. No matter how much I dig into my brain, I cannot muster up the words to describe it any further.

  Your answer: In my experience, destructuring is a device we (developers) use when values need to be taken out. I've only used it within objects and am totally down with you sharing some chit chat about your destructoring experience.  

  Researched answer: destructoring is a js call that unpacks (extracts) values from arrays and objects and binds them to variables. Destructing can extract multiple properties in one statement and even set a default value if one does not exist.


4. What is the difference between a function and a method?
  Your answer: As far as I am immediately aware, methods are specifically used objects. They basically the same thing but objects use methods instead.


  Researched answer: Aside to what was made aware above, Methods and functions are similiar yet different in the fact that functions live on their own and the data passed through is explicit while methods are directly associated to an object and is implicitly called upon by the object.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: The best way I can describe it would be using an anology of our class. Myself, as a student, would represent the object and the cohort would represent the class, as I am just a part (object) of the class

  Researched answer: Class is a template used in JS in order to create objects and doesn't allocate memory space where as object results from class and allocate memory space when created.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting is java is a tool used to to pull call on a function even if it is under the code. After we covered it this week in class i looked into why we were having trouble with executing the hoist and saw something along the lines of; there are two different categories of functions and hoist works with only 1 of them.

  Researched answer: It's basically what I posted above. The two categories I referenced where function EXPRESSION and DECLARATION. It turns out that function expressions cannot be hoisted.

  //FUNCTION DECLARATION/
  // function greeting() {
  //   console.log("hello"); //  If you run this below it will be hoisted
  //   ///////FUNCTION EXPRESSION
  //   const talk = function(){
  //     console.log('bueno!'); // if you run this below it will not, however this is the most used function process
  //
  //   }

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: gives the developer the ability to reuse classes

2. React: Open-source js library developers use for building ui. Created by Suckerberg's Company.

3. React state: How dumb components send info up the river to smart ones.

4. React lifecycle methods: Components in react have a three phase lifecycle and they are mounting, updating, and unmounting.

5. DOM: JS library used for better ui services and is more efficient that previous ui services.
